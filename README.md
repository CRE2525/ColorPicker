# ColorPicker
Color picker web browser game

How it works:

You are given a rgb(r, g, b) value at the top which is some colour. The numbers for r, g, b can be 0-255, representing the amount of red green and blue the colour is made up of. You then have to guess the correct color.

If an incorrect colour is picked, it disapears. If you guess the right colour, you win. Good for you!

Ez mode limits the amount of colours to 3.
